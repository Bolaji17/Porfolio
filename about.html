            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>With a strong foundation in web design and development, I have built my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Vue.js. My journey into the tech world was driven by a curiosity for how websites function and a desire to build seamless digital experiences.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I have developed a keen eye for design and a love for coding. I enjoy tackling challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web. When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good book.</p>
            <p>My goal is to continuously improve my skills and create impactful web applications that make a difference. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
